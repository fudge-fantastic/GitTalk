## TODO's for GitTalk

1. Display the projects in the sidebar and allow them to be deleted, created and renamed
2. User Badge should have the First and the Last name of the user. For instance: John Doe will be JD, Dark Lord will be DL, or Mark Zuckerberg will be MZ
3. Work with the user badge functionality to allow the user to perform certain operations
